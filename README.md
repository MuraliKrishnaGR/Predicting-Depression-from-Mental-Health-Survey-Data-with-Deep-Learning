# Predicting Depression from Mental Health Survey Data with Deep Learning

This project utilizes a neural network model to predict whether an individual is experiencing depression based on various personal, lifestyle, and work-related features. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training (handling class imbalance), evaluation, and a user-friendly **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions.

## Overview  

This project builds a **binary classification model** to predict depression status using a **deep learning-based pipeline**. The key components include:

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Conducted in a Jupyter Notebook (`health.ipynb`).
- **Neural Network Training:** A TensorFlow/Keras-based model trained with computed class weights to handle **class imbalance**.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and fairness evaluation across demographic groups.
- **Deployment:** A **Streamlit app** allowing users to enter their details and receive predictions with **motivational messages** based on the result.

---

## Jupyter Notebook  

The **`health.ipynb`** notebook contains the following steps:  
- Data Cleaning & Exploration  
- Handling Class Imbalance  
- Feature Engineering & Encoding  
- Neural Network Training using **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Model Evaluation with **classification metrics**  
- Saving the trained **model & scaler** for deployment  

---

## Dataset  

The dataset contains multiple features related to **age, work pressure, sleep duration, job satisfaction, financial stress**, and **mental health history**. The **target variable** is:  
- `Depression`: **1 (Depressed), 0 (Not Depressed)**  

class weights are used to improve model performance.

| `Working_Professional_or_Student_Working_Professional` | 1 if working professional, 0 if student |
| `Have_you_ever_had_suicidal_thoughts_?_Yes` | 1 if Yes, 0 if No |
| `Dietary_Habits_Moderate` | 1 if dietary habits are moderate, 0 otherwise |
| `Dietary_Habits_Unhealthy` | 1 if dietary habits are unhealthy, 0 otherwise |
| `Family_History_of_Mental_Illness_Yes` | 1 if Yes, 0 if No |

## Model Architecture  

The model is a **feedforward neural network** with the following layers:
- **Input Layer:** Accepts all feature inputs.
- **Hidden Layers:**  
  - **Dense Layer (32 neurons, ReLU activation) + Dropout (0.2)**
  - **Dense Layer (16 neurons, ReLU activation)**
- **Output Layer:**  
  - **1 neuron (Sigmoid activation)** for binary classification.

**Optimizer:** Adam | **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy

## Streamlit Application

The Streamlit app offers a simple interface for real-time depression prediction. Users enter their personal details, and the app uses a pre-saved scaler and trained neural network (`keras_model.h5`) to output a prediction ("Depressed" or "Not Depressed") along with a tailored motivational message.

### Running the App

1. Ensure `keras_model.h5` and `scaler.pkl` are in the project directory.
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   
### Live Demo
